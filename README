Caterpillar is a PHP library intended for website crawling and screen scraping.  It handles parallel requests using a modified 
version of the Rolling Curl (http://code.google.com/p/rolling-curl/) library which utilizes curl_multi() functions in an efficient 
manner.  Because requests are handled in parallel, the fastest completed requests will trigger enqueuing any newly found URLs, 
ensuring the crawler runs continuously and efficiently.  Rolling Curl is set to allow for a maximum number of simultaneous 
connections to ensure you do not DOS attack the requested host with requests.
